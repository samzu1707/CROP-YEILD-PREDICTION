# CROP-YEILD-PREDICTION

## 🚜 Project Overview  
The **Crop Yield Prediction** project aims to predict agricultural crop yields based on key input factors such as climate, soil / environmental variables, and historical data. By using machine learning techniques, this project helps farmers and decision-makers estimate likely crop yield ahead of time — enabling better planning, resource allocation, and agricultural management.

## 📊 Motivation & Problem Statement  
- Crop yield depends on many variables (weather, rainfall, soil, area, fertilizer, etc.), and manually estimating yield is often inaccurate.  
- A data-driven model can combine these variables to provide a reliable yield prediction — helping in planning sowing, harvesting, resource use and avoiding losses.  
- Especially in regions with variable weather and limited resources, such a predictive tool can support food security and improve farming outcomes.

## ✅ Key Features & Approach  
- **Data Preprocessing** — cleaning, handling missing values, converting data types, filtering invalid entries before training.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — analyzing relationships between features (rainfall, temperature, fertilizer, soil nutrients, etc.) and yield.  
- **Model Training with Machine Learning** — using regression algorithms (e.g. Decision-Tree, Random Forest, etc.) to predict yield based on input features.  
- **Model Evaluation** — computing performance metrics (e.g. R² score, RMSE, MAE) to assess model accuracy.  
- **Flexibility for Multiple Crops / Conditions** — ability to adjust input features depending on crop type, region, season.

## 🛠️ Technologies / Libraries Used  
- Python (core programming language)  
- Pandas, NumPy — for data handling and manipulation  
- scikit-learn — for ML models and evaluation  
- (Optional) Matplotlib / Seaborn — for visualization and EDA
